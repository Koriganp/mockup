			<p>Anything you want to do you can do here. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Isn't that fantastic?</p>

			<p>You can spend all day playing with mountains. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. This piece of canvas is your world. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.</p>

			<p>We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. All kinds of happy little splashes. Just make little strokes like that. Brown is such a nice color. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Anyone can paint.</p>
